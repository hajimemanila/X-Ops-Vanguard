# 🚫 Zero Trace

> *Leave nothing behind. Not even a pattern.*

**Zero Trace** is a heuristic timeline sanitizer designed for X (formerly Twitter).
Unlike traditional "mass deletion" bots that trigger account locks, Zero Trace operates with **human-aligned heuristics**.

### 🛡️ Why "Heuristic"?
Traditional cleaners use API spamming or mechanical DOM interaction, which leaves a distinct "bot fingerprint" in server logs.

**Zero Trace** implements the **X Ops Doctrine**:
1.  **Kinematic Cursor:** Simulates organic mouse movement to target buttons.
2.  **Stochastic Timing:** Deletion intervals follow a Gaussian distribution (human rhythm), not a fixed timer.
3.  **Visual Confirmation:** "Looks" at the post before acting, just like a human operator.

### 📉 Zero Latency, Zero Footprint.
Keep your account healthy. Keep your timeline clean. Stay under the radar.
